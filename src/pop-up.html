      <p class="instructions">"Preheat oven to 350° F. Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with non-stick spray.\r\nCombine soy
        sauce, ½ cup water, brown sugar, ginger and garlic in a small saucepan and cover. Bring to a boil over medium
        heat. Remove lid and cook for one minute once boiling.\r\nMeanwhile, stir together the corn starch and 2
        tablespoons of water in a separate dish until smooth. Once sauce is boiling, add mixture to the saucepan and
        stir to combine. Cook until the sauce starts to thicken then remove from heat.\r\nPlace the chicken breasts in
        the prepared pan. Pour one cup of the sauce over top of chicken. Place chicken in oven and bake 35 minutes or
        until cooked through. Remove from oven and shred chicken in the dish using two forks.\r\n*Meanwhile, steam or
        cook the vegetables according to package directions.\r\nAdd the cooked vegetables and rice to the casserole dish
        with the chicken. Add most of the remaining sauce, reserving a bit to drizzle over the top when serving. Gently
        toss everything together in the casserole dish until combined. Return to oven and cook 15 minutes. Remove from
        oven and let stand 5 minutes before serving. Drizzle each serving with remaining sauce. Enjoy!"</p>
